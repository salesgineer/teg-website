# Comprehensive Prompting Pattern Library

This reference contains proven prompting patterns organized by category, with examples and guidance for each.

## Foundational Patterns

### 1. Zero-Shot Prompting
**When to use**: Simple, well-defined tasks where the model has sufficient training data.

**Pattern**:
```
[Clear task description]
[Any necessary context]
[Output specifications]
```

**Example**:
```
Summarize the following article in 3 sentences, focusing on the main argument and key supporting evidence:

[Article text]
```

**Why this works**:
- **Explicit constraints** ("3 sentences") prevent overlong summaries
- **Focused direction** ("main argument and key supporting evidence") guides what to extract
- **Single instruction** keeps cognitive load low for straightforward tasks
- Model training includes millions of summarization examples, so pattern recognition activates immediately

**Strengths**: Simple, token-efficient, works well for common tasks.
**Limitations**: May struggle with novel or highly specific tasks.

**When it fails**: See [Ambiguity Failures](../references/failure-modes.md#ambiguity-failures) if output format unclear, or [Assumption Failures](../references/failure-modes.md#assumption-failures) if context insufficient.

**Model notes**: All major models (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini) handle zero-shot well for common tasks. See [Model Quirks](../references/model-quirks.md) for model-specific optimization.

### 2. Few-Shot Prompting
**When to use**: Tasks requiring specific format, style, or approach that's easier to show than describe.

**Pattern**:
```
[Task description]

Example 1:
Input: [Example input 1]
Output: [Example output 1]

Example 2:
Input: [Example input 2]
Output: [Example output 2]

Now complete:
Input: [Actual input]
Output:
```

**Example**:
```
Extract key entities from customer feedback and categorize sentiment.

Example 1:
Input: "The new interface is confusing but the customer service team helped me figure it out."
Output: {"interface": "negative", "customer_service": "positive"}

Example 2:
Input: "Fast shipping and great product quality!"
Output: {"shipping": "positive", "product_quality": "positive"}

Now complete:
Input: "Disappointed with the battery life, though the screen is beautiful."
Output:
```

**Why this works**:
- **Pattern demonstration**: Examples teach the model the exact format and style, not through description but through demonstration
- **Edge case handling**: Example 1 shows mixed sentiment (negative + positive in same input), which is harder to specify in instructions
- **Format precision**: JSON structure is immediately clear from examples, no need for schema description
- **Implicit rules**: Model infers rules like "extract multiple entities" and "per-entity sentiment" from examples alone

**Strengths**: Highly effective for format specification, style matching, edge case handling.
**Limitations**: Uses more tokens, requires good examples.

**Best practices**:
- Use 2-5 examples (more rarely helps)
- Include edge cases in examples
- Ensure examples are high quality
- Make examples diverse

**When it fails**: See [Reasoning Failures](../references/failure-modes.md#reasoning-failures) section on "Insufficient Example Diversity" if model struggles with variations not shown in examples.

**Model comparison**:
- **Claude**: Excellent at inferring patterns from 2-3 examples
- **GPT-4**: May benefit from one extra example for complex formats
- **Gemini**: Works well with 3-4 examples for structured tasks
See [Model Quirks](../references/model-quirks.md) for detailed guidance.

### 3. Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
**When to use**: Complex reasoning tasks, math problems, multi-step logic.

**Pattern**:
```
[Problem description]

Think through this step-by-step:
1. [First reasoning step]
2. [Second reasoning step]
...
Therefore, [conclusion]
```

**Example**:
```
A store sells apples for $0.50 each or $5 for a dozen. If I need 30 apples, what's the cheapest way to buy them?

Think through this step-by-step:
```

**Why this works**:
- **Forced decomposition**: "Step-by-step" requirement prevents jumping to conclusions
- **Intermediate verification**: Each step can be checked for logical consistency
- **Error reduction**: Multi-step problems solved as sequence of smaller problems have dramatically lower error rates
- **Transparency**: Reasoning is visible and debuggable, unlike direct answers

**Research basis**: Chain-of-thought prompting improves accuracy on reasoning tasks by 40-60% compared to direct answering (Wei et al., 2022). The improvement comes from forcing the model to "show its work" rather than pattern-matching to an answer.

**Strengths**: Dramatically improves reasoning accuracy, makes logic transparent.
**Limitations**: Uses more tokens, slower.

**Variations**:
- "Let's think step by step" - proven effective phrase
- "Show your work" - educational framing
- "Explain your reasoning" - professional framing
- "Walk me through your logic" - conversational framing

**When it fails**: If reasoning goes off track, see [Reasoning Failures](../references/failure-modes.md#reasoning-failures). For multi-step tasks requiring orchestration, see [Planner-Executor Pattern](../references/orchestration-patterns.md#3-planner-executor-pattern).

**Model performance**:
- **Claude**: Excellent at maintaining coherent reasoning over many steps
- **GPT-4**: Strong reasoning, may occasionally skip steps if not explicitly required
- **Gemini**: Good analytical reasoning, benefits from explicit step numbering
For detailed model guidance, see [Model Quirks](../references/model-quirks.md).

## Structured Output Patterns

### 4. JSON Output Specification
**When to use**: Need structured, machine-parseable output.

```
[Task description]

Respond ONLY with valid JSON in this exact format:
{
  "field1": "description",
  "field2": "description",
  "nested": {
    "field3": "description"
  }
}
```

**Example**:
```
Analyze this product review for sentiment and key topics.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON in this exact format:
{
  "overall_sentiment": "positive|negative|neutral",
  "sentiment_score": 0-100,
  "key_topics": ["topic1", "topic2"],
  "purchase_intent": "high|medium|low|none"
}

Review: "Great product but shipping took forever."
```

**Strengths**: Reliable structured output, easy to parse programmatically.
**Best practices**:
- Use all caps for "ONLY" to emphasize format constraints
- Provide exact schema
- Include type hints
- Specify valid values for enum fields

**Strengths**: Frames response appropriately, activates relevant knowledge.
**Limitations**: Can introduce unnecessary jargon if role not well-chosen.

---

### 8. Audience-Specific Framing
**When to use**: Content that must be appropriate for specific audience level.

**Pattern**:

## Pattern Selection Guide

**Simple factual tasks**: Zero-shot prompting
**Format-specific tasks**: Few-shot prompting
**Reasoning tasks**: Chain-of-thought
**High-stakes decisions**: Self-consistency + Reflection
**Complex projects**: Hierarchical breakdown + Iterative refinement
**Domain expertise**: Role assignment + Context framing
**Multi-part responses**: Delimited sections + Structured output

**Combine patterns** when dealing with complex requirements. Most effective prompts use 2-3 patterns together.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**Vague instructions**: "Make it better" → Specify what "better" means
**Over-complexity**: 10 requirements → Focus on 2-3 critical requirements
**Conflicting constraints**: "Be brief but comprehensive" → Choose one
**Implicit assumptions**: Model can't read your mind → State everything explicitly
**Over-politeness**: "If you don't mind, could you possibly..." → Be direct and clear
